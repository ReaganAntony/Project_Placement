1. Data Accumulation:
Data accumulation involves gathering data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or web scraping, to create a dataset. This step is crucial for ensuring that you have sufficient and relevant data to train a model effectively.

2. Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values, outliers, duplicates, or incorrect data types. This step ensures that the dataset is accurate and suitable for analysis.

3. Encoding:
Encoding transforms categorical data into numerical format so that machine learning algorithms can process it. Techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding are commonly used to convert categorical features into numeric values.

4. Train & Testing the Model:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, typically using an 80-20 or 70-30 split. The model is trained on the training set and then tested on the testing set to evaluate how well it generalizes to unseen data.

5. Model Selection:
Model selection involves choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for your task. This step may include experimenting with multiple algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and using techniques like cross-validation to determine which model performs best.

6. Model Performance:
Model performance is assessed using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error, depending on the problem type (classification or regression). Performance evaluation helps determine the model's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
